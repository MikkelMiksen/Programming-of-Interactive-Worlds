# ⚙️ PIW: Dieselpunk Survival Outpost

A dieselpunk-inspired survival simulation set in a post-industrial wasteland where technology runs on smoke, oil, and ingenuity. Players must manage heat, hunger, and scarce resources to endure the harsh environment while maintaining their outpost.

## 🧭 Overview

**PIW: Dieselpunk Survival Outpost** is a resource management and survival game built in **Unity**.  
You oversee a small outpost in a frozen wasteland, where **fuel, temperature, and time** are your most precious resources.  

The gameplay blends **systemic survival mechanics** with **visual feedback loops** — such as environmental temperature shifts, UI indicators for resource consumption, and dynamic day-night cycles.

## 🔩 Core Features

- **Dynamic Temperature System**
  - The world temperature changes throughout the day-night cycle.
  - Player temperature is influenced by proximity to heat sources (e.g., furnaces).

- **Resource Management UI**
  - Clean, data-driven panels showing health, food, water, furnace heat, time, and season.
  - Designed with layout groups for flexible scaling and easy modification.

- **Seasonal Progression**
  - Date and time advance naturally through the cycle, with visual and mechanical effects tied to seasons.

- **Dieselpunk Atmosphere**
  - Visuals inspired by oil-era machinery, industrial rust tones, and minimal high-tech influence.
  - Everything feels heavy, tactile, and slightly grimy — survival by engineering, not magic.

## 🧊 Key Systems in Development

- **Internal body temperature simulation**
  - Player maintains an equilibrium affected by ambient and artificial heat sources.
- **Heat diffusion from furnaces and structures**
  - Environment temperature gradually stabilizes near active heat sources.
- **Dynamic resource slots**
  - Reusable UI elements (icon + text) for resource display and HUD updates.
